            <h3>2022</h3>
            <p>For over a decade, a potential way to drastically shorten the speedrun route was stuck at a dead-end. LoD’s debug room could be accessed through the save-over glitch, but it left the party at level 0 and the first battle would result in a game over since Dart had no hit points (0/0). However, in early 2022, progress was made at long last. This gave players the new option of a skip-included run. Already, a time of less than four hours has been recorded!</p>
